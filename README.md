# Keyboard layout for Macbook
My keyboard layout consist of three parts:
- JSON file for [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) located at ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json;
- HotKey keyboard shortcuts to launching and fast switching between applications;
- and bundle file which contains english and russion keylayout for macOS located at ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts.

HotKey shortcuts (hyper as a leader key):
- f — browser;
- d — Sublime Text;
- s — terminal;
- a — Spotlight;
- e — Emacs;
- g — Finder.
